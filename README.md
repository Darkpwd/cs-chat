Technologies Used:

- 🌟 MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js): This full-stack JavaScript solution powers the app, providing a robust back-end (Node.js and Express) along with a scalable database (MongoDB) and an interactive front-end (React).
- 🎃 Socket.io: A powerful library for enabling real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and server. Used for real-time messaging and ensuring users can chat instantly.
- 👾 A utility-first CSS framework that allows for fast and efficient styling. With its pre-built classes, it makes responsive and modern design easier to implement.
- 🚀 Daisy UI: A component library built on top of TailwindCSS, providing ready-to-use UI components, making the development process smoother and faster.
- 👌 JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Utilized for handling authentication and authorization, ensuring that users can securely log in and access protected routes.
- 🐞 Error handling both on the server and on the client
- ⭐ Zustand: A small, fast, and scalable state management solution for React applications. It helps manage global state without the complexity of other solutions like Redux.
